      <h1>The Plan</h1>

      <p>This training program was created with the goal of being simple but well rounded. There is not enough volume
        here to get <em>huge</em>, but the structure can absolutely be used to build a strong muscular frame or maintain
        existing gains.</p>

      <p>At the time of writing this I was dealing with some elbow pain during certain movements so the intent was to
        primarily focus on basic compound lifts for the main movement patterns while still including some direct work
        for smaller muscle groups that haven't received as much stimulus.</p>

      <p>The basic structure is three days of "fully body" training, with one day per week dedicated to isolation work
        for the arms and shoulders.</p>

      <h1>Day 1 - Heavy</h1>
      <p>Heavy day isn't just about using challenging weight, it's about using big free weight movements that will
        challenge multiple muscles.</p>
      <p>The goal is to use a weight heavy enough that you can do atleast 6 reps per set, but cannot do more then 10.
        Some exercises may feel better on the heavier end of the range, such as the barbell bench press, whereas others
        like bent over barbell rows might feel safer using a little less weight and staying closer to 10 reps.</p>
      <P>As long as you're working somewhere in the 6-10 rep range you're on track for Day 1.</P>

      <p>Light day doesn't mean <em>easy day</em> - it means our exercise selection is less demanding and easier to recover from
        after beating ourselves up on Day 1.</p>
      <p>Bodyweight movements, or movements which by their very nature cannot or do not need to be loaded heavy are
        ideal.</p>
      <p>Goblet squats are a great example - you can add weight by holding a dumbbell or kettlebell but you can only
        hold so much before it becomes impractical. Back raises, glute-ham raises, dips, pull ups, push ups, walking
        lunges etc are all great options.</p>
      <p>The rep range isn't too strict as sometimes the exercise and your current strength level will guide you, but generally somewhere in the 10-20
        rep range is where we want to be.</p>

      <h1>Day 3 - Medium</h1>
      <p>Difficulty level here on Day 3 should be somewhere between Day 1 and Day 2. Various machines or even dumbbells will do the trick but stay away from heavy barbell movements.</p>

      <p>Think leg presses or belt squats, lat pulldowns or cable rows, machine presses, and leg curls for the hamstrings. Keep reps in the 8-15 range. A set of 8 reps of cable rows likely won't provide the same stimulas as 8 barbell rows, but it <em>will</em> be much easier to recover from and gives you some flexibility in using different cable attachments. That said, I usually prefer to use higher reps for pulling movements.</p>
      <p>For example, on Day 1 I would keep my Barbell Rows close to 10 reps, and here on Day 3 I would keep my Lat Pulldowns closer to 15 reps.</p>

      <h1>Day 4 - Bodybuilding Day</h1>
      <p>Today is mostly about aesthetics - building strong shoulders and arms, but it's also about balance.</p>
      <p>Too much pressing can cause the shoulders to round forward and encourage bad posture, so it's important that we include some direct work for the rear deltoids as well.</p>
      <p>Cable face pulls (or similar variations) are great for overall shoulder health, while reverse dumbbell or cable flyes are also great for targeting the rear delts.</p>
      <p>Starting with a vertical press is a good way to warm up before hitting the side and rear delts with direct work.</p>
      <p>When it comes to arm training I've always had a better bicep pump and mind-muscle connection when training triceps first, so we will be alternating between the two. Start with a set for triceps, rest for 60-90 seconds, then a set for biceps. We're not performing 'supersets' - we're alternating sets, which means we still rest between exercises.</p>
